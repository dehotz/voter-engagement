### Voter Engagement Web-App Overview

<p>This project will be a tool for voters to use to assist them in getting data about elections in a given area and the respective candidates and issues. It will allow users to enter an address and see information about upcoming elections in the particular area, candidates, contact information, and recent news articles about those candidates and issues.</p>
<p>This project is motivated by a need for voters to be able to gather the information about their representatives, candidates, and issues in one place without having search across multiple sites.</p>

### What I'll Have to Learn
<p>Tying the address to a particular district and getting news links based on keyword searches will both require data from outside sources, therefore I'll have to learn to integrate with multiple third-party APIs for the functionality of my program.</p>

<p>Additionally at least one of the APIs will be using JavaScript and I'll have to learn how to incorporate that into my project.</p>
